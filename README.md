Implement string to decimal converter without using any prebuilt functions/classes that do any sort of string to number conversion automatically.
#Examples:
- “2.345” should become 2.345
- “1” should become 1.0
- “-345.23” should become -345.23
- “asd32” should throw an error
- “2.334.4” should throw as error
- If the string input cannot be represented as a decimal value due to precision, overflow or underflow problems throw an error.
